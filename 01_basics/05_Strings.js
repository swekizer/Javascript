// Strings in javascript

// Strings are used to store text. Strings must be enclosed in quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
let name = "John";
let name2 = 'Doe';

// You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

let text = "He's called 'John'";
let text2 = 'He\'s called "John"';
